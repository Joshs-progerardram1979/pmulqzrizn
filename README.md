Just walked out of Screamboat and wow, what a ride!!, my god... my head's still spinning and not sure is it the  … or these infernal noisey kids squawkin’ behind me or– If I ever see popcorn again, it’ll be too soon. Just crumbs on my coat, everywhere like ghost footprints on fresh snow or somethin.

So there's this ghost ship, kind of like a haunted buffet, serving up terror and screams instead of shrimp cocktails, hah. Man, that captain, yeesh, his eyes – like saucers, like the ones my grandma served beans in, thinking they’ll overflow with tears or fear… or chili sauce maybe. 

> There was a part with this storm that felt like nature was having a tantrum, throwing waves around like an angry kid launching mashed peas. Not sure what got me more, the sound of the wind or the dude next to me opening candy wrappers slower than, like… evolution. By the way, did I tell you, felt like my chair was made of stone, or maybe old farm equipment left in a field to rust in the rain.

This couple was sitting up front kissing during the scariest bit, like they'd just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in a different universe. eh. And suddenly, it hit me, yeah? — is fear romantic? Couldn’t decide whether to laugh or buy them popcorn, if i hadnt turned it all into crumbs already.

Someone asked me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for them later, but I’m honestly thinking it's one of those “you-have-to-be-there moments”.

The ship's foghorn is still foghorning in my brain, like a cow mooing in an echo chamber. The ghosts were more like spectral tour guides, with dramatic flair; if i wasn’t scared, I'd have asked one “hey, got any life advice?”. But they’re probably busy haunting and all that jazz. 

Oh, and if ya remember Frances asked if she should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   - I'm thinking definitely, but bring ear plugs and maybe a rain jacket?

Stuff like the haunted anchor dragging souls down, that’s one for late-night pillow thoughts, maybe haunts you or maybe it's just an unresolved metaphor for life or oatmeal. My back is… gonna haunt me for days, sat there like a scarecrow at rest. Couldn’t tell what spooked me more, the noises from the screen or me missing the call of my comfy bed. 

Okay, enough of this jumbled mess. Kinda fun pentin’ it tho. Hang tight, buddy, might need a minute to detox from this one. 

```csharp
public void GhostlyHaunt(int nightmareIntensity)
{
    //loop of fear
    while(nightmareIntensity > 0)
    {
        nightmareIntensity--;
        if(nightmareIntensity < 5)
            break; // when dew drops stop
    }

    // accidental ship noises
}
```
